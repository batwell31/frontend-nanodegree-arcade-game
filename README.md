## CHARACTER SELECTION ##
 (**WARNING: THIS WILL RESET THE GAME, AS WELL AS YOUR SCORE!**)

 I have implemented the option for character selection!

1. Walk your player over to the selector image on the bottom right of the screen
    * Notice a Modal will apear
2. Click the character (button) you wish to be!
    * THIS WILL RESET YOUR GAME
3. Selecting a different character will also reset your location (**closing the modal**)
    * Also walking away from the selector platform will also close the modal!
    * Give it a try!
   
## MUSIC CONTROLS ##

Music will start playing upon page load.
You can:
* Pause the music by pressing the 'Pause Button'
    * Turn it back on by pressing the 'Play Button'

* Mute the music by pressing the 'Speaker Button'
    * Un-Mute the music by pressing the 'Muted-Speaker Button'

## HOW TO PLAY ##

* The goal is to reach the water without getting hit by the 'bugs'
    * Reaching the water will:
        * Add 1 point to your total score
        * Reset your position to where you first started!
    * Colliding with an enemy will:
        * Cause your score go down 1 point, so becareful!
* The player (you) will move with the arrow keys on your keyboard.
    *(Left/Right/Up/Down)
